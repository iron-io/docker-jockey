- set token when writing upstart config for sshttp or write sshttp config file and read that when starting.
- make an AMI that already has docker installed to make this faster. 
- Sometimes VPC's dont make dns host names: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-dns.html, should use the public IP or at least document it.
